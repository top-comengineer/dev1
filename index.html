            <p>We also take care to stay green when we scrap your vehicle. Car recycling is a key part of our service

              goal is to go one step further. Our aim is to divert 100% of vehicle waste from going to landfill, so that
              every part of your car is reused. When you sell your car to us, you’re helping us work towards that goal!

        <h3 itemprop="question">How much money can I get for scrapping my car?</h3>
        <p itemprop="acceptedAnswer"> How much you’ll get for your scrap car depends on a whole range of factors. Most
          of these are well outside your control, so they’re not anything to worry about. <br><br><strong>Some of the
            main factors which affect how much cash you’ll get include:</strong><br> • Supply and demand of the scrap
          metal market <br> • The make and model of the car <br> • The size and weight <br> • Its age <br> • Whether or
          not it’s had parts removed <br> • The location of the scrap yard taking it <br><br> One of the main ways you
          can ensure you maximise the value of your car is by making sure you don’t take it to pieces before you send it
          off to be scrapped. Removing particularly heavy or critical parts like the engine will have a serious impact
          on how much scrap yards are willing to pay for it. <br><br> Location is also a hugely influential factor.
          After all, for scrap yards, processing your car involves a cost-benefit analysis. The further they have to
          travel in order to collect your car, the more they’ll have to charge to cover their overheads. <br><br> That’s
          why the closest local scrap yards are able to offer the best value for your end of life vehicle, and why
          location is always a high priority of ours when we're calculating your instant scrap car quote. <br><br> If
          you’d like, you can turn to our blog for a more detailed breakdown of what affects <a

      <article class="faq" itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
        <h3 itemprop="question">What documents do I need to scrap my car?</h3>
        <p itemprop="acceptedAnswer"> You’ll be pleased to hear you don’t need that much paperwork to scrap your car,
          and it’s generally a lot more simple than making a private sale. <br><br><strong>The main documents you’ll
            need include:</strong><br> • V5C logbook or registration certificate <br> • The service history <br> • The
          latest MOT certificate <br> • SORN (if applicable) <br><br> If you’ve got any additional paperwork, such as
          anything to do with the vehicle finance, that’s worth handing over too. You can provide all this to a friendly
          member of our collection team when we swing by to pick up your vehicle (And of course, it makes everything a
          whole lot quicker and more simple if you can give us the keys). </p>

      <article class="faq" itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
        <h3 itemprop="question">What happens if I’ve lost my V5C?</h3>
        <p itemprop="acceptedAnswer"> If you’ve lost your V5C, some people may advise you to apply for a new one from
          the DVLA, at the cost of £25. However, this isn’t strictly necessary, as you don’t actually need it to scrap
          your car. (You don’t even need it to privately sell your vehicle, although undeniably it makes it a bit more
          difficult. Most buyers will be wary of buying the car unless they see proper physical documentation!) <br><br>
          The reason you don’t need it to scrap your car is because all details are checked on the DVLA database. This
          means that as long as you can prove you’re the registered keeper of the vehicle, and all the information is up
          to date, we can recycle your car without your physical V5C logbook. <br><br> What we do advise, though, is
          separately getting in touch with the DVLA yourself to let them know you’ve scrapped your car.
          <br><br><strong>Here’s what you’ll need to let them know:</strong><br> • Your car registration number <br> •
          The make and model <br> • The exact date of sale <br> • The name and address of the scrapyard <br><br> For
          more information, feel free to check out our post on <a

      <article class="faq" itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
        <h3 itemprop="question">How do you scrap your car for money?</h3>
        <p itemprop="acceptedAnswer"> Over a million cars are scrapped in the UK each year, and finding the best price
          used to be a fairly intensive process - involving multiple phone calls to separate scrapyards, or whiling away
          valuable free time on comparison websites. <br><br> Thankfully, now that we’re well into the digital age, it’s
          all easier than ever! <br><br> The process is slightly different depending on whether or not you want to keep
          any parts from your car. We’ve into full extensive detail on our post on <a
            href="https://www.scrapcarnetwork.org/news/how-to-scrap-a-car/">how to scrap your car</a> , but here are the
          basics. <br><br><strong>If you want to scrap your car without keeping any parts, you have to:</strong><br> •
          Apply to take off the registration number (if you want to keep it) <br> • Scrap your car at an Authorised
          Treatment Facility <br> • Hand over your V5C or vehicle logbook, but keep the yellow slip <br> • Inform the
          DVLA, and get your Certificate of Destruction <br><br><strong>If you want to keep some parts from your car
            before you scrap it, you must:</strong><br> • Obtain a SORN through the DVLA <br> • Apply to take off the
          registration number (if you’d like) <br> • Remove the parts you want <br> • Scrap the rest at an Authorised
          Treatment Facility <br> • Hand over your V5C or vehicle logbook, but keep the yellow slip <br> • Give them the
          SORN, if it’s still in effect <br> • Inform the DVLA and get your Certificate of Destruction <br><br> It’s
          worth remembering, though, that removing parts from your vehicle will have a pretty serious impact on its
          value to the scrap yard, which means you’ll end up with less cash for your car. For that reason alone, it’s a
          job worth tackling only if you’ve got the professional expertise necessary to remove and sell them! </p>

          here at Scrap Car Network, all charges are included in the quote we give you. That means no nasty surprises,
          so you’ve got a more accurate idea of what to expect in terms of cash for your car. That’s the way we like to

              cannot be repaired […]</p>
